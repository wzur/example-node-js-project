Before you start
----------------

This project builds and starts Docker container. You have to have a local Docker engine installed first.

TL;DR
-----

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
docker-compose up --build -d && python test.py --port 443 --cert-path ./nginx/localhost.crt
```

What does it do
---------------

* Creates a simple Node.js application from [server.js]
* Packages a simple Node.js application into a Docker container, see [Dockerfile]
* Orchestrates Nginx to be in a front of the Node.js application and a Redis server to act as a database for
the application with Docker compose, see [docker-compose.yml]
* Test the application with a Python script ([test.py]), taken from https://github.com/paxosglobal/devops-test-script
* Redis database is stored in on a Docker volume

Requirements
------------

* Node.js
* Python
* Virtualenv
* Docker engine

[Dockerfile]: ./Dockerfile
[docker-compose.yml]: ./docker-compose.yml
