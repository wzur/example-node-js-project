```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker-compose up --build -d
```

What does it do

* Creates a simple Node.js application from [server.js]
* Packages a simple Node.js application into a Docker container, see [Dockerfile]
* Orchestrates Nginx to be in a front of the Node.js application and a Redis server to act as a database for
the application with Docker compose, see [docker-compose.yml]
